# Background  

All of a sudden, I want to use a continuous memory space to simulate the linked list, so that the destruction can be done in one time, without the extra destruction of the number of Elemnt in the stack, thus creating the nk-stack  

nk-stack only provides push, pop, peek interface.   

this version only provides basic functionality. it is not multi-thread safe   
# Install.   
just make , the target is "nk-stack"
